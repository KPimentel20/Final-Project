App Title: musicMAKES

Purpose: The purpose of musicMAKES was to create a space where people can have access to other people's playlists and share music with one another. It's modeled after Spotify in a way where users can create their own playlist based off of what they normally like listening to. I really wanted to implement a third party API to allow users to learn a lot more about the artist and song they are listening to like for example, the lyrics, or the meaning behind an album, or an artists background. musicMAKES is still a work in progress but for now it features basic create, read, and delete functionality for playlists.

Next Steps:
* Consume data from a third party API (like Spotify)
* Make it responsive to mobile devices
* Add a musicgenre Model
* Add how long the songs are using a 3rd party API
* I want viewers to see a variety of music and/or artists to listen to based on their own music interests

Takeaways:
Prioritize your health. I had strep and was very close to having walking pnuemonia for almost two weeks. I'm finally feeling a better but its incredibly hard to learn how to implement an API or even do the project when you dont feel well physically. I really want to revisit this and work on it when I'm not sick. I also should have focused more on meeting MVP before trying to make a 3rd party API work because I got really carried away with that and lost time. I cant really tell if I like or dont like using these technologies, I've been too sick to really understand whether or not im enjoying the tools or not. I felt like I really just needed to just do this and i did not really get the luxury of knowing if i enjoyed it. i was pretty miserable these past few days due to my physical state of being.
